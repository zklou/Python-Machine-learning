    "### Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The red wine industry shows a recent exponential growth as social drinking is on the rise. Nowadays, industry players are using product quality certifications to promote their products. This is a time-consuming process and requires the assessment given by human experts, which makes this process very expensive. Also, the price of red wine depends on a rather abstract concept of wine appreciation by wine tasters, opinion among whom may have a high degree of variability. Another vital factor in red wine certification and quality assessment is physicochemical tests, which are laboratory-based and consider factors like acidity, pH level, sugar, and other chemical properties. The red wine market would be of interest if the human quality of tasting can be related to wine’s chemical properties so that certification and quality assessment and assurance processes are more controlled. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to implement Regression Models and Classification Models on the Red Wine Quality Dataset to determine which features are the best quality red wine indicators and generate insights into each of these factors to our model’s red wine quality."

    "Evaluating the model accuracy is an essential part of the process in creating machine learning models to describe how well the model is performing in its predictions. Evaluation metrics change according to the problem type. Here, we'll briefly learn how to check the accuracy of the regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear model (regression) can be a typical example of this type of problem, and the main characteristic of the regression problem is that the targets of a dataset contain the real numbers only. The errors represent how much the model is making mistakes in its prediction. The basic concept of accuracy evaluation is to compare the original target with the predicted one according to certain metrics.\n",

    "The MAE, RMSE, and R-Squared metrics are mainly used to evaluate the prediction error rates and model performance in regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**MAE (Mean absolute error)** represents the difference between the original and predicted values extracted by averaged the absolute difference over the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** is the error rate by the square root of MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "**R-squared (Coefficient of determination)** represents the coefficient of how well the values fit compared to the original values. The value from 0 to 1 interpreted as percentages. The higher the value is, the better the model is.\n",

    "The above metrics can be expressed as following:\n",
